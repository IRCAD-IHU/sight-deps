## Description

This repository contains CMake scripts to download, build and install the additional libraries necessary to compile `Sight` on **Linux**.
As more libraries are found as official Linux packages, less and less has to be built from this repository.

They need to be built first in order to compile anything from the [main repository](https://git.ircad.fr/Sight/sight).

## Install

See how to install `Sight` :
 - [sight-doc install](https://sight.pages.ircad.fr/sight-doc/Installation/index.html)

## Documentation
