# Discontinued

As of July 2019, we no longer support this repository.

Sight uses [conan](https://docs.conan.io) to manage its binary dependencies. Please read the [documentation](https://sight.pages.ircad.fr/sight-doc/Installation) for more information.

If you still want to use `sight-deps` with Sight, we recommend that you checkout all repositories at a version inferior to 18.1.0
