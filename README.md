# Discontinued

As of July 2019, we no longer support this repository.

Sight uses [conan](https://docs.conan.io) to manage its binary dependencies.
Please read the [documentation](https://sight.pages.ircad.fr/sight-doc/Installation) for more information.

If you still want to use `sight-deps` with Sight, we recommend that you checkout all repositories at a version inferior to 18.1.0

## Description

This repository contains CMake scripts to download, build and install the library necessary to compile `Sight`.
They need to be built first in order to compile anything from the [main repository](https://git.ircad.fr/Sight/sight).

## Install

See how to install `Sight` :
 - [sight-doc install](https://sight.pages.ircad.fr/sight-doc/Installation/index.html)
